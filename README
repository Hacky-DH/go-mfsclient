this is a client library for MooseFS [1], and a web server (mfsserver) 
to serve files from MooseFS.

Before you have a try, you should install a recent Go release first, then:

$ git clone https://github.com/davies/go-mfsclient
$ cd go-mfsclient
$ make
$ ./mfsserver -h 
Usage of ./mfsserver:
  -addr=":9500": http service address
  -cpuprofile="": write cpu profile to file
  -mfsmaster="mfsmaster": the addr of mfsmaster

** mounting subdir is NOT supported now, will been added later.
